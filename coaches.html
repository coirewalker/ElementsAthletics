                    <p>Mike, having competed nearly half his life in his beloved sport of rugby, decided 5 years ago to have a try a Muay Thai. Having dabbled prior interest in the art, as well as several other martial arts, he and a friend began their training via multiple World Champion Thai Boxer and legend, Coban Lookchaomaesaithong. Under his tutelage and fostered by an enthusiastic passion for the "Art of 8," Mike trained competitively and assisted members as a Senior Student. This is where he met and began to train with Kai Fetzer. When Coban moved his camp in 2014, Mike graciously accepted the invitation that Ken Ng of C1 MMA extended to instruct kickboxing classes, which he applies to his coaching. Mike brings a warm knowledge of fitness, technique, and integration of healthy living to Roots Athletics.

                    <p>Srijan is a lifelong athlete that found his love for Muay Thai during his time attending Pace University. He shifted from more ‘traditional’ sports like basketball, soccer and tennis because of the mentally and physical challenging nature of Muay Thai. He has trained for over nine years and has competed in the United States, China, and Thailand. He has been coaching and helping others in their personal Muay Thai journeys for the past four years. He firmly believes that Muay Thai is for everyone, regardless of age or fitness level. He believes training in the ultimate striking art has transformed his mind, body, and spirit and hopes to be able to share that tool with others. Srijan met coaches Kai and Mike while they all studied under world Champion Coban Lookchaomaesaithong, and shares their philosophy of training hard with a big smile.
