                	<h4 class="push--20">Background</h4>
                    <p>Kitfox started training capoeira with Mestre Acordeon at his academy, home of The United Capoeira Association, at the age of 17. A childhood spent running through forests and scaling granite boulders over rivers in Northern California prepared him for the physical and mental rush of the capoeira roda. It only took one look at the capoeiristas flipping and kicking through the air for him to say to himself, “I’m going to learn to fly!”
                    </p>
                    <p>Traveling over 200 miles at least twice a month to take classes, in 2001 Kitfox moved to Santa Cruz, California and joined Raízes do Brasil Capoeira under the tutelage of Mestre Papiba. Eventually Kitfox received the principled title of “Instructor”. Over the years he would explore a diverse interest in martial and movement arts, but capoeira remains his first love. Manteiga shares his love of capoeira through his teaching with an emphasis on body organization and movement.

                    <p>A life built on movement--first with gymnastics, then classical ballet--yoga made its debut into Hillary's life as a therapeutic remedy to a dance related knee injury. The moment she experienced breath-based movement she traded passions and never looked back.

                    <p>Over the past 6 years there have been many teachers who guided Hillary's path of uniting soul, heart, body and mind. In 2010 she attended the ISHTA 200hr training. Shortly thereafter she decided to spread the gifts she was experiencing to children and young adults by attending the Little Flower Yoga training program, training kids ages 4-18 years old in the NYC education system. In the summer of 2012 she blended her passions for community action, social change, and wellbeing by joining the Off the Mat Into the World Organization, for their leadership training in social justice. Always looking to continue learning as student herself, in the summer of 2014 Hillary was part of the inaugural vinyasa teacher training at Prema Yoga Brooklyn. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether Hillary is leading a small group of middle school students, older kids, or adults on the mat, she always strives toward revealing the higher self in each of us.
