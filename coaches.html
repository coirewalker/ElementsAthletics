Fostered by an enthusiastic passion for the "Art of 8,"  Mike began to train competitively under Coban’s tutelage and in 2014 accepted an invitation from Ken Ng of C1 MMA to instruct kickboxing classes.

                    <p>Srijan is a lifelong athlete that found his love for Muay Thai during his university years when he shifted his focus from more ‘traditional’ sports like basketball, soccer, and tennis to the mental and physical challenges of Muay Thai.

                    <p>Srijan firmly believes that Muay Thai is for everyone, regardless of age or fitness level. He also believes this training has transformed his mind, body, and spirit, and he enjoys being able to share these tools with others. Srijan met fellow coaches Kai and Mike while they were all studying together under world Champion Coban Lookchaomaesaithong and shares their philosophy of training hard with a big smile.</p>

                	<h4 class="push--20">Background</h4>
                    <p>Kitfox started training capoeira with Mestre Acordeon at his academy, home of The United Capoeira Association, at the age of 17. A childhood spent running through forests and scaling granite boulders over rivers in Northern California prepared him for the physical and mental rush of the capoeira roda. It only took one look at the capoeiristas flipping and kicking through the air for him to say to himself, “I’m going to learn to fly!”
                    </p>
                    <p>Traveling over 200 miles at least twice a month to take classes, in 2001 Kitfox moved to Santa Cruz, California and joined Raízes do Brasil Capoeira under the tutelage of Mestre Papiba. Eventually Kitfox received the principled title of “Instructor”. Over the years he would explore a diverse interest in martial and movement arts, but capoeira remains his first love. Manteiga shares his love of capoeira through his teaching with an emphasis on body organization and movement.

                    <p>Christopher began been training in Japanese Goshin Jiu Jitsu.  Goshin Jiu Jitsu is more akin to Judo in that the practice is split evenly between stand-up and ground work.  Christopher pursued this for seven years under sensei Steven Sciandra, a black belt under Master Yoichiro Matsumura, founder of the Goshin Jiu Jitsu System.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Preferring the ground work over stand-up combat, Christopher pursued Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under World champion Vitor Shaolin Ribeiro for the following six years, training and competing, until earning his brown belt in 2013.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Christopher currently trains under Unity Jiu Jitsu with Murilo Santana, and coaches here at Elements.  His training motto is “Be respectful, be positive, be honest, train hard, and fight the hardest.”

                    <p>Clara started her Muay Thai training in Sweden 15 years ago, when she was 14. She had her first fight at 18, and a year later she moved to Thailand to train for the two years following.  Clara was the Swedish Champion and Nordic Country Amateur Champion, both at 51kg, in 2007-2008, and held the Amateur World Cup Bronze at 48kg in 2008.  
                    </p>
                    <p>After 29 professional fights and an impressive record of victories, Clara has since switched her focus to sparring—-the strategy required is what she loves, and Clara views the physical conditioning that comes from artful, applied sparring as a nice bonus.
